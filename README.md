An aruco marker is a fiducial marker that is placed on the object or scene being imaged. It is a binary square with black background and boundaries and a white generated pattern within it that uniquely identifies it. The black boundary helps making their detection easier. They can be generated in a variety of sizes. The size is chosen based on the object size and the scene, for a successful detection. If very small markers are not being detected, just increasing their size can make their detection easier.
