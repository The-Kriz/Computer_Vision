An aruco marker is a fiducial marker that is placed on the object or scene being imaged. It is a binary square with black background and boundaries and a white generated pattern within it that uniquely identifies it. The black boundary helps making their detection easier. They can be generated in a variety of sizes. The size is chosen based on the object size and the scene, for a successful detection. If very small markers are not being detected, just increasing their size can make their detection easier.

## Camera Calibration
Camera calibration is the process of finding the true parameters of the camera that took your photographs. Some of these parameters are focal length, format size, principal point, and lens distortion.

Radial distortion causes straight lines to appear curved. Radial distortion becomes larger the farther points are from the center of the image

## Object tracking

Object tracking is a deep learning process where the algorithm tracks the movement of an object. In other words, it is the task of estimating or predicting the positions and other relevant information of moving objects in a video
